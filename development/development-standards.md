# Development Standards

## Software Development Standards and Best Practices

### 1. Version Control and Commit Standards

#### Conventional Commits

Follow the Conventional Commits standard for version control:

* `feat`: Introduce a new feature
* `fix`: Fix a bug
* `docs`: Documentation changes
* `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
* `refactor`: Code refactoring without changing functionality
* `perf`: Performance improvements
* `test`: Add or modify tests
* `chore`: Maintenance tasks (e.g., build processes, tooling)

#### Git Flow

* Follow a structured branching model like Git Flow
* Use feature branches for new development
* Maintain a stable main/master branch
* Use release branches for version preparation

#### Pull Requests and Code Reviews

* Create pull requests for all significant changes
* Conduct thorough code reviews before merging
* Use automated checks in the PR process (linting, tests, etc.)

### 2. Service Architecture and Design

* Keep business logic in the service layer, not in controllers
* Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) instead of returning entities directly to clients
* Implement circuit breaker pattern for API integrations
* Apply rate limiting to all services
* Set timeouts for all services and Feign clients
* Implement retry mechanisms for remote service calls
* Use Swagger or OpenAPI for comprehensive API documentation
* Implement asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
* Consider microservices architecture for large, complex systems
* Implement API versioning to manage changes without breaking existing clients
* Use service discovery in microservices architecture

### 3. Data Handling and Persistence

* Use optimistic locking for handling potential data conflicts
* Perform aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG) at the database level
* Create indexes on frequently queried entity fields
* Implement caching for frequently accessed or static data
* Apply pagination for large data sets (>50 records)
* Use bulk operations for processing large datasets
* Configure database connection pooling properly
* Implement thorough data validation to ensure integrity
* Consider soft deletes for important data
* Implement audit trails for tracking changes in critical data

### 4. Code Quality and Standards

* Always perform null and empty checks before operating on data
* Use guard clauses instead of nested if-else statements
* Keep classes under 500 lines and methods under 50 lines
* Adhere to a consistent coding style across the project
* Maintain high unit test coverage, especially for critical components
* Use static code analysis tools like SonarQube
* Document complex algorithms and business logic in code
* Consider pair programming for complex features or knowledge sharing

### 5. Error Handling and Logging

* Use appropriate log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR) consistently
* Return clear and meaningful error messages in API responses
* Implement global exception handling
* Use centralized logging for easier troubleshooting in distributed systems
* Implement error tracking and alerting for production environments
* Provide clear, non-technical error messages to end-users

### 6. Performance and Optimization

* Prefer batch API requests over multiple sequential calls
* Avoid service calls in loops; use bulk operations instead
* Properly configure connection and thread pools
* Regularly conduct load and stress tests
* Use profiling tools to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks
* Use Content Delivery Networks (CDN) for static assets in web applications
* Regularly review and optimize slow database queries

### 7. Security

* Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
* Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms
* Use HTTPS for all communications
* Implement security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.) in web applications
* Use a secure vault for managing secrets and credentials
* Conduct periodic security audits of the system
* Perform regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities

### 8. Deployment and CI/CD

* Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
* Use feature flags to manage feature rollouts and A/B testing
* Consider blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates
* Use semantic versioning for clear communication of version changes

### 9. Monitoring and Maintenance

* Implement health checks for all services
* Gather and analyze key performance and business metrics
* Set up alerting for critical system issues
* Create monitoring dashboards for system overview
* Consider implementing chaos engineering to test system resilience
* Conduct post-mortem analysis after significant incidents

Remember to regularly review and update these standards and practices to keep them aligned with evolving technology trends and team needs.
